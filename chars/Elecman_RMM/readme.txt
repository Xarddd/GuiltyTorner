=================================================

History:  
A robot to work on the voltage control of nuclear energy. With sharp judgement and quick movements, he can perform fierce attacks. Among the robots Dr. Light developed, he is one of the best.
"Do your worst, but I find it hard to believe that such a low-voltage robot like you can defeat me."

---------------------------------[ About ]--------------------------------------

MODEL NUMBER: DLN/DRN-008
FIRST APPEARANCE: Mega Man (NES - 1987)

Elec Man (エレキマン Erekiman) is a Robot Master from the original Mega Man. He was created by Dr. Light to control the voltage of nuclear power plants. At the time of his creation, Elec Man was often hailed as Dr. Light's greatest creation and boasts razor-sharp judgement, as well as a physical agility that would not be matched until the creation of Quick Man, who is in turn based on his design. His Special Weapon, the Thunder Beam, fires off devastating bolts of very high-voltage electrical energy in multiple directions, with sufficient power to go through multiple enemies with one shot and even break through solid rocks.

In terms of personality, Elec Man is conceited and egotistical, with something of a sadistic streak in him (which is especially present in Mega Man Powered Up), but is otherwise very responsible, smart and competent. In his spare time, he has taken up playing the electric guitar while singing. Fitting for his motif, he also despises products made of rubber.
