Customized version of Dr. Wily from Mega Man series, strongly based on his arcade appearances but also throughout the many classic games. He's intended to have a unique gameplay against the general Capcom cast, so it may take some time to understand his mechanics.

He can call for a Robot Master individually, that has his own set of moves, or call a team of Robots for a Level 3 Hyper move.
The default number for the assists stock is 5, and only resets upon a new match. You can, however, fill the assists stock by performing the Alternate Taunt, at the cost of 1 power bar.

Combo notes
===========

Dr. Wily uses a variation of the Vs. Style from the old Capcom crossovers, in which its system relies mainly on chaining moves into each other. Here are his basic combo rules:

1.  You can combo from lighter basic attacks into stronger ones
    eg. light kick -> strong kick

2.  You can combo into special attacks from all basic attacks
    eg. strong punch -> Skull Fire

3.  You can cancel into hyper attacks from most basic and special
    attacks
    eg. Skull Blast -> Wily War

3.  You can cancel a basic attack into a dash, or a dash into a basic attack
    attacks
    eg. strong punch -> forward dash -> strong punch

These rules make it possible for you to do some damaging combos.
Experiment, and perfect your own mad Combos!
