Crashman V3  1/30/2020
Sprited By: Laspacho

--------------------------------------

History:  
Crashman was built by Dr. Wily to withstand explosions. He has high agility and enhanced armor (his body is protected with a thick armor) allowing him use of his main weapon, A drill-type bomb called the Crash Bomber. He appears to be an enhanced version of Bombman. 
"You think I'm some knock-off, is that it? I'm all the power of Guts Man and Bomb Man combined, you little punk! Who are you to talk, Mr. Copy-powers-'cause-you-got-none?!"
