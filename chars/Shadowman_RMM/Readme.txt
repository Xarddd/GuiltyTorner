Thank you for download this character. This is the third release of "Shadowman", character property of Capcom. 
This character was originally build over the fighting system of the Full Game "Capcom Fighting All-Stars",
but later adapted to the Robot Master Mayhem system.

════════════════-[ What is new ]═══════════════════


VERSION 3.0 - 2019-12-30

1- Invisibilty
2- Projectile Immunity
3- Throw Immunity
4- Attack Boost
5- Deffense Boost
6- Speed Boost


Version 20180101

- Upgraded idle animation
- New hyper > QCB + PP: Shin Izuna Otoshi
- Changed the command for Oriental Express
- Improved codes and animations
- Recovery Roll



This version also contains some of the fixes made by Superteletubbies64:

- Fixed misattributions of moves that were stated to be Specials or Hypers in the Readme so they are now correctly attributed as such
- Replaced all instances of fall.recovery=0 with fall.recover=0 so they now inflict hard knockdown as intended instead of soft knockdown
- Added Oriental Express to the Readme because it was not present for some reason
- Airborne X Shadow Blade and Jiraya now hit OTG
- Tengu Man's attack during the Oriental Express Hyper now inflicts hard knockdown so that the opponent can no longer avoid Yamato Man's attack by recovering from Tengu Man's attack
- Added 6 new palettes by GazpachoMasterX (Cutsman, Dank, Desert, Hierophant, Leafy and ProtoGuy)


Version 03012010

- Fixed several bugs
